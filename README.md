# Image inpainting via dictionary learning and sparse representation
This project aims at rebuild "damaged" pictures by learning a sparse representation of non-damaged patch of the image.


## Model
The model is composed of 3 Linear regressions (one per channel) with L1 regularization (aka Lasso).
It encodes the picture to a HSV color model, normalize its pixels between [-1, 1], and learn which sparse combination of pixels can properly rebuild the picture.

## TODO
* Implement a CLI.
* Find a better heuristic for patch approximation order.
* Rewrite the model in PyTorch for GPU acceleration.
* Make the linear model a parameter of the Inpainting class.
